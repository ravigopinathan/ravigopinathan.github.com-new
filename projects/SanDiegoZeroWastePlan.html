  San Diego has created an ambitious <br>
  “zero waste” plan to reduce waste by 75% by 2030.
</p>
Zero waste is the idea that every piece of waste can be reduced, reused, recycled, or composted. Here is a wikipedia page on what is zero waste

Although there is a lot of work by the city being done on reducing landfill waste, a lot of the emphasis on recycling and composting is in response to actions the state of California has taking to require cities to recycle more and reduce waste. Currently at 44% of all waste in california being diveted we are among the states with the highest proportion of waste being diverted.

  Bellow is a link to a website called CalRecycle, an organization the state of california created to transition cities and facilities into compliance with recycling laws.
