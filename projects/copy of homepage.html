          San Diego has created an ambitious “zero waste” plan to reduce waste by 75% by 2030. The city officials are trying to divert waste from the landfills for the sake of the environment.  There are serious future environmental problems that we are causing when hundreds of thousands of tons of garbage are the thrown into one single landfill every year.  The waste that is disposed of is mainly plastic, paper, and food waste, and when bacteria break down these materials, they produce methane, which is a Greenhouse gas.  Methane takes around 8 years to decompose in the atmosphere and has 20 times the global warming potential than carbon dioxide.  Also, a liquid called lechate seeps out of the bottom of the garbage in a landfill, which contaminates groundwater and puts the water supply of future generations at risk.  Because of these concerns, landfills aren't a sustainable way to dispose of waste, and the city of san diego is trying to reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfills.
